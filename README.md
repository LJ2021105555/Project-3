# Physics Engine Project

This is a 2D physics engine implemented using Python and Pygame. The engine includes features such as:
- Gravity and collision detection using the GJK algorithm.
- Elastic collision response with impulse calculation.
- Particle system for explosion and smoke effects.

## Features
1. **GJK Collision Detection**
2. **Rigid Body Dynamics**
3. **Elastic Collision Response**
4. **Particle Effects**

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies: `pip install pygame`
2. Run the main script: `python main.py`
